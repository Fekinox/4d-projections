# 4d-projections
Computer program for the Fall Term Research Paper.

The following libraries were used, along with the C++ STL:
OpenGL (Glad, GLFW, GLM)
  Used to create the visualizations.

Eigen
  Eases the heavy lifting for the more linear-algebra intensive parts of the project. I didn't really want to re-invent the wheel and manually calculate determinants, etc. so this is a massive help.
